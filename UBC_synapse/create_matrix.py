"""Functions for building the morphology of a synapse.

This modules meets two goals:
    1. Determining relevant ranges of parameters to model synapses. They should be close to those observed in vivo.
    2. Building matrixes to represent the morphology of the synapses.

The model of a synapse consists in three matrixes:
    * the synapse area (glomerulus) is a disk,
    * the glutamate release sites are homogenousely distributed on ths area, according to a hexagonal grid,
    * the extra glomerular area, between the borders of the synapse and the limits of the working area.
These matrixes are boolean matrixes, containing 1s in the pixels representing the corresponding areas, 0s elsewhere.

    A hexagonal grid is a symetric network of points, which are all at equal distance from eachother.
    To gain flexibility in the different number of points that can be obtained, several geometries are consideredfor the grid:
        * "standard hexagonal grid": grid featuring a hexagonal external shape, i.e. whose borders form a perfect hexagon.
        * "derivatives" are obtained by adding points around each side of the hexagon, ensuring symetry:
            * "star shaped grid": obtained from a "standard grid" whose number of points on a side is even, by adding one single point at a distance from the middle of each side ; 
            * "flower shaped grid":
                * either obtained from a "standard grid" whose number of points on a side is odd,

    In this module, a hexagonal grid is described by two parameters:

            It is also equal to the number of points forming a side of a "standard hexagonal gird".

        * p : number of points added to the "standard grid" of the current order, to obtain a particular derivative grid.
            All standard hexagonal grids are associated with p = 0.
            All "star shaped" grids are associated with p = 1.
