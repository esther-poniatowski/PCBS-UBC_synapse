# PCBS-UBC_synapse
Modeling signal filtering in the synapse between Mossy Fibers and Unipolar Brush Cells

---

The cerebellum is a brain area involved in the representation of movement and position. This high-level representation seems to be achieved through the integration and the disambiguation of sensory signals. This idea motivates to investigate the determinants of the signal processing, that might lie at the level of the neurons.  

In the cerebellum, the signal flows through a feedforward circuit :  
(1) It receives direct sensory inputs from the vestibular system of the inner ears, conveyed by the mossy fibers (MF). This signal is produced by sensors of inertial translational and rotational acceleration.  
(2) In the cerebellum, the mossy fibers contact the Unipolar Brush Cells (UBCs).

The cerebellum features a high density of these remarkable interneurons, which display a very particular type of synapses. Indeed, the many convolutions of their synaptic clefts lead to a giant contact surfaces, riddled with neurotransmitter release sites.  
This observation triggers the hypothesis that the synapse MF-UBC could play a role in the signal transformation, potentially by acting like a filter.  
**The goal of the project is to explore the influence of the synapse's morphological and physiological properties on the signal transformation.**

The original project was conducted in 2018-2019 in the context of an biology L3 intership, under the direction of Guillaume Dugu√©. For the current project, the focus will be directed to getting in shape the original project. The aim is to provide a reusable, sharable and understandable tool, in view of further research.  
Thus, the main goals are the following :  
* Translating the code from R language to Python language.
* Optimizing the code, in terms of runtime and memory footprint.
* Respecting the "Pythonic best practices" : "don't repeat yourself", modularity, abstraction.
* Automating the workflows as much as possible.
