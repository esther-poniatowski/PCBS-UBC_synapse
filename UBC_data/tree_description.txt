The synapses and the data generated by running the package can be saved in the directory `UBC_data/`, thanks to the methods of the class Synapse.

The file `register_syn.csv` keeps track of the saved synapses: 
    * the different instances are classified according to their attributes,
    * each saved synapse is referenced by an index (number).

Each saved synapse is associated to a sub-directory named `sny{index}`. One directory contains:
    * a file `responses_syn{index}_register.csv`, classifying the stimulation trials with this synapse, and referencing them by an index (number),
    * directories `resp{index}_syn{index}/`, one for each trial, containing the results.

For each stimulation trial, the results are made up of:
    * `coords.csv`: locations of the points on the synapse where the glutamate concentrations were recorded,
    * `resgluxx-xx.csv`: variations of the glutamate concentration at location xx-xx (row-column),
    * `resAMPAtot.csv`: evolution of the activation state of the post-synaptic AMPA receptors,
    * `resV.csv`: variations of the UBC's membrane potential.
